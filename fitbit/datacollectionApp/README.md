We Developed an application on fitbit in order to collect data for the machine learning model. 

The application has four buttons, one to start recording, one to stop recording, one to save recording and then send recording.

The applicaiton can also change the name of the activity by clicking on the name of the activity on the bottom of the screen.

These data are sent to our firestore backend to download them and train the model with them.
